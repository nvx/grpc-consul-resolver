# gRPC Consul resolver
This lib resolves Consul services by name. 

# Usage

Somewhere in your `init` code: 
```go
import (
    "github.com/nvx/grpc-consul-resolver"
)

// Will query consul every 5 seconds.
resolver.RegisterDefault(time.Second * 5)
```

Getting connection:
```go
conn, err := grpc.DialContext(ctx, "consul://service/my-awesome-service")
```

Using a tag
```go
conn, err := grpc.DialContext(ctx, "consul://service/my-awesome-service/http")
```

Using a prepared query
```go
conn, err := grpc.DialContext(ctx, "consul://query/my-awesome-query")
```

With round-robin balancer:
```go
import (
    "google.golang.org/grpc/balancer/roundrobin"
)

conn, err := grpc.DialContext(ctx, "consul://service/my-awesome-service", grpc.WithBalancerName(roundrobin.Name))
```
